<strong>Ex. 1 –</strong><em> Simple questions</em>

<ol>

 <li>Alice want to arrange a secret meeting with Bob. Using Caesar cipher she sends the ciphertext Unfortunately brainless Bob has forgotten the secret key they agreed on. Help him finding where to meet Alice.</li>

 <li>Using a Hill cipher the ciphertext corresponding to<em> dont</em> is ELNI. Find the encryption matrix.</li>

 <li>Let a, b, and n be three positive integers such that<sub> n<em>l</em>ab</sub> and gcd(a, n) = 1. Prove that n<em>i</em>b.</li>

 <li>Compute gcd(30030, 257), providing the details of your calculations. Deduce than 257 is prime.</li>

 <li>Explain why using the same key twice in the 0TP is dangerous.</li>

 <li>Assuming that the best algorithm that determines whether two finite graphs are isomorphic has</li>

</ol>

O<strong><em>i</em></strong>√n log n<strong><em><sup>‘</sup></em></strong>

complexity 2 ‘                        ‘, what size of graph should be used to be secure?

<strong>Ex. 2 –</strong><em> Vigenère cipher</em>

<ol>

 <li>Research and explain how the Vigenêre cipher works.</li>

 <li>Bob being exhausted he falls asleep on his Vigenêre encryption device and sends the same letter repeated several hundred times. The key is a six letters long English word.</li>

 <li>Why can Eve suspect that the plaintext is one repeated letter?</li>

 <li>How can Eve guess the key length?</li>

 <li>How can Eve determine the key?</li>

</ol>

<em>Hint:</em> no English word of length six is a shift of another English word <strong>Ex. 3 –</strong><em> Programming</em>

<ol>

 <li>Install the GNU Multi Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP) from https://gmplib.org/ or its fork MPIR available at http://mpir.org/. Note that MPIR has a better support for Windows, although no binaries are officially provided. GMP is available on any modern Linux distribution.</li>

 <li>Implement the extended Euclidean algorithm.</li>

 <li>Write a short program that generates two random 4096 bits integers, computes their gcd using the previous implementation and compares it to the result of the corresponding GMP function.</li>
